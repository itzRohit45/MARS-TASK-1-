# Task-1: MARS Club Project Documentation
## By: Rohit Kumar

### Project Overview:

This project includes various levels of tasks categorized as Light-Dose, Medium-Dose, and Strong-Dose. Each level involves different challenges and learnings.

### Light-Dose:

#### Ubuntu Commands:
I enjoyed exploring some of the useful commands and experimenting with the Linux Terminal. The commands I used include:

1. `chmod`: Used to change file permissions (read, write, executable).
2. `pwd`: Displays the current directory.
3. `ls`: Lists files inside directories.
4. `ls -a`: Displays hidden files.
5. `mkdir`, `gedit`, `cp`, `mv`, and many others.

#### Bash Scripting:
Here, I first learned the basics of scripting like variables, arrays, loops, conditionals, and operators. Using these, I designed the given task.

### Medium-Dose:

#### Custom Data Type and Managing the Data:
- I used the concept of structure (user-defined data type) and learned about classes to create a variable (object) capable of storing custom data.
- Explored lambda functions and utilized them in various contexts.

### Strong-Dose:

#### Playing with Numbers:
I implemented the logic of finding all prime factors, storing them in a container (set for unique elements), and then searching for four consecutive integers whose four prime factors are distinct.
Concepts used: Prime numbers, factors, loops, and data structures.

#### Playing with Images:
This task was challenging and new for me. I first learned briefly about the Pillow (PIL) library in Python and used it by downloading its package along with Python. I applied concepts of range loops in Python and used methods like `open`, `size`, `show`, `get_pixel`, and `put_pixel`.

### Overall Experience:
This project provided a great learning experience. The tasks were well-prepared by the Software team of MARS club, offering a comprehensive exploration of various concepts and challenges.
