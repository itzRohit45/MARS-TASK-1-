     The Project includes:
    
## Light-Dose:
* Ubuntu Commands
                 I enjoyed exploring some of useful commands and experimenting with Linux Terminal.
                 The commands used:
                               1.chmod- To change files permissions(read,write,executable)
                               2.pwd- current directory
                               3.ls- listing files inside directories
                               4.ls -a: hidden files visible
                               5.mkdir,gedit,cp,mv,many others
* Bash Scripting 
                  Here I first learnt basics of Scripting like Variables,arrays,loops,conditionals,operators.
                  Using these I designed the given task.

## Medium-Dose:
* Custom-data type and Managing the Data 

                   Used the concept of structure(user-defined data_type) and also at the same time i learnt the concepts of classes so i used it also to create a variable(object) which can store custom datas.After that I gained some knowledge about inline function known as Lambda function.Used the function in different ways.

## Strong-Dose
* Playing with Numbers
                       Firstly for this task i implemented logic of finding all prime factors and then stored them in container set(unique elements) and then moved to the part where we have to search four consecutive integers whose four prime factors are distinct.
                       Concepts used: Prime numbers,factors,loops,data structures.

* Playing with Images 
                      This task was obviously new and out of range for me.
                      So I first learnt (in brief) about Pillow(PIL) library in Python and used the library by downloading its package along with Python.
                      Used the concepts of Range loops in python,Methods applied to object like (open,size,show,get_pixel,put_pixel).

 Overall it was great experience and learnings that i got through this task.Very well prepared task by the Software team of MARS club.
